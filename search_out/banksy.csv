Banksy is an anonymous England-based street artist and political activist known for satirical and subversive graffiti art in public spaces.  Their identity remains unknown despite international fame.  Banksy's work often critiques consumerism, war, and political systems, using stencils and other techniques.  Their art has been displayed in galleries and sold for high prices, but they also create works spontaneously in urban environments.  The secretive nature of their work and identity contributes to their mystique and impact.
