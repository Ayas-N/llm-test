I do not have enough information to summarise the SCTP spatial transcriptomics algorithm in the requested format.  My search results provide mentions of SCTP in the context of spatial cell-cell interaction analysis within a larger platform called `stLearn`, but don't offer a standalone algorithm description with sufficient detail for a complete summary using the provided template.  To create the summary, I would need access to a publication or documentation specifically describing the SCTP algorithm's methodology, implementation, and application details.
