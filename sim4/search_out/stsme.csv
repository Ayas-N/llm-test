I do not have enough information to summarize the stSME spatial transcriptomics algorithm using the requested format. My search results indicate that stSME is a method within the larger `stLearn` platform, focusing on imputation of spatial gene expression data.  However, the available information lacks the detailed methodological description necessary to complete the summary table. To provide a comprehensive summary, I would need access to a publication or documentation that thoroughly details stSME's algorithm, implementation, and application specifics.
