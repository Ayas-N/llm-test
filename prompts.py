Context-Aware representation: Spatially transformed gene expression matrix (This refers to when the method section describes the input gene expression matrix being augmented by spatial information before it is converted to any form of embedding such as a PCA), Low dimension with spatial embedding (This means the gene experssion matrix has been converted to an embedding before being used alongside with the spatial information for clustering), Accessibility (Whether you can access this representation of the data). \n
Input Data: Raw or Normalised \n
Dataset Resolution: Low-Resolution (We consider this to be datasets with spot sizes above 10 microns, I.e. multiple cells in a spot), High-resolution (We consider this to be datasets with spot sizes less than or equal to 10 microns), Cellular, Segmentation-Free Subcellular. \n
Multisample Analysis: Can the algorithm be ran on multiple samples at once? \n
Notable Datasets: DLPFC Visium, Mouse Hypothalamus MERFISH, Spot-Based Low Resolution, Spot-based high resolution, Imaging-based. \n
Reference Inclusion: scRNA-seq, Imaging Data, None. \n
Scalability: <10k Cells (Can likely only run on < 10k cells), <100k Cells, < 1M Cells(The memory and runtime scale such that the algorithm can be ran on around 1 million cells, scaling linearly is an indication of poorer scaling.), Multimillions (Algorithm can run even on millions of cells), Unclear. \n 
Overcoming Limitations: Segmentation Errors (Is the clustering method designed in mind to deal with issues arising from segmentation errors?), Spot Swapping (Does it focus on dealing with the spot swapping issue as arising from segmentation errors?), Sparsity (Does the method issues that arise from data sparsity), Batch Effects, Resolution, Rare Cell Types. \n 
Stage Spatial information is added: Spatially Transformed gene expression matrix, Joint low dimension embedding, Tailored (neither transformed gene expression or joint embedding). \n 
Metrics Used for evaluation: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalised Mutual Information (NMI), and any others you can think of. \n
Levels of Simulation: Simulation included, Scalability assessment (The assessment must be in the Simulations section of the paper), Accuracy assessment in the simulation (Assessment must be under the simulations part of the article). \n

Assistant has access to the following tools:

{tools}

To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```
Use all tools once before responding. pdf_read will give you a pdf of the publication.
When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:
